  <p>The majority of extant traditional Chinese architecture was constructed for the purposes of ritual. Palaces to shelter images of spirits, they were designed to project the identity and status of a particular divinity as well as to enhance the efficacy of specific rituals. Donor names and dates of construction and restoration were inscribed on stelae and elements of the building to ensure proper acknowledgement of patrons. Thus, careful study of the style, materials, and construction techniques employed to create these buildings, as well as epigraphic information on site concerning patronage, has the potential to enhance not only our understanding of the aesthetics of traditional Chinese architecture over time and space, but also our understanding of the trade networks, crafts traditions, and spiritual aspirations of people living in pre-modern China.</p>
   <p>When complete, the Traditional Chinese Architecture Digital Research Tool will be a be a public, browser-based architectural history research tool consisting of four parts: 
   <ol>
     <li>A linked open data (LOD) database of architectural complexes and individual structures searchable both by name of site (ancient and modern) and by technical terminology used to describe individual elements of single timber-frame buildings that are known to vary across regions. Search terms will be in Chinese (traditional and simplified scripts), pinyin Romanization of modern Mandarin, and English translation. </li>
     <li>A photo archive of images keyed into the search terms of the database. This archive is based on my own photographs of more than one hundred middle-period structures and the building complexes of which they are part. This will be supplemented with architectural drawings to further research and teaching.</li>
     <li>A digital mapping tool that will allow search results to be located on a map of modern China using U.S. Geological Survey public domain base maps. This will be linked to the photo archive to facilitate viewing of search results through the map interface.

  <p> <img src="img/Lingyansi-medium.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right:20px; margin-bottom:20px;" />The Traditional Chinese Architecture Digital Research Tool is, at its core, a digital image archive of the monumental architecture of pre-modern China. The dataset is focused on our earliest extant examples of timber-frame architecture in China, largely dating from the 8th-13th centuries, and includes information on construction techniques as well as stylistic features. The vast majority of these buildings were constructed for ritual purposes, therefore data on style and structure of the buildings, as well as epigraphic information on site concerning patronage, have the potential to enhance not only our understanding of the aesthetics of traditional Chinese architecture over time and space, but also our understanding of the trade networks, crafts traditions, and spiritual aspirations of people living in pre-modern China.</p>
   <p>Currently in active development, the Traditional Chinese Architecture Digital Research Tool will be a be a public, browser-based architectural history research website. To see an example of our trial site (set up with the help of Steve Baskauf) click <a href="http://bioimages.vanderbilt.edu/tang-song.html" target="_blank">here</a>
     <p> When complete the tool will consist of four parts: </p>
     <p>1. A linked open data (LOD) database of architectural complexes and individual structures searchable both by name of site (ancient and modern) and by technical terminology used to describe individual elements of single timber-frame buildings that are known to vary across regions. Search terms will be in Chinese (traditional and simplified scripts), pinyin Romanization of modern Mandarin, and English translation. </p>
     <p>2. A photo archive of images keyed into the search terms of the database. This archive is based on my own photographs of more than one hundred middle-period structures and the building complexes of which they are part. This will be supplemented with architectural drawings to further research and teaching.</p>
     <p>3. A digital mapping tool that will allow search results to be located on a map of modern China using U.S. Geological Survey public domain base maps. This will be linked to the photo archive to facilitate viewing of search results through the map interface.

     <ul>
       <li>The mapping tool will make use of the Vanderbilt Historical Gazetteer app, an open source application developed locally at Vanderbilt under the direction of Dave Michaelson and Steve Wernke.</li>
       <li>Map output will be available in digital and analog forms for peer-reviewed publication. Although the research tool is designed primarily to allow digital searching and mapping of Chinese architecture, results of that research will ultimately be published in both digital and analog forms. We acknowledge that digital tools are both portable and powerful, however static version of search results, in the form of a single pdf, or as part of an article or book are still critical for archiving. </li>
     </ul>
     <p>4. Photographs and transcriptions of epigraphic information found at a given site. Titles of stele inscriptions and donor names will be searchable using traditional Chinese characters.</p>

  <div class="row faqs">
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>Why learn About Linked Data and the Semantic Web?</strong><br>
      For a long time, our data has been constrained in "silos" created by the structure of our databases.
      But we want to be able to share, reuse and integrate our data with the global information network. Linked Data can help with that.

    </p>
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>Why Linked Data and the Semantic Web for Digital Humanities?</strong><br>
    One of the hallmarks of humanistic research is the ambiguous nature of our inquiries.
    Linked Data and the Semantic Web offers the opportunity to use digital tools that better fit our data models.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>Why Linked Data and the Semantic Web for Digital Science?</strong><br>
      Scientists especially, need to be able to share data openly and across boundaries. Also, network analysis in the sciences
      is critical to understanding relationships between data points.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>What if I am not a technical person?</strong><br>
      No need to worry. Discussion is both technical and
      theoretical and the group participatory  so anyone can join at any time!
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>What should I bring?</strong><br>
      If you can, please bring a laptop with you to the sessions. If you don't
      have a laptop, you can always check one out from the library. We're agnostic
      about operating systems—Linux, OSX or Windows are all fine.
    </p>
    <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
      <strong>Can I join anytime?</strong><br>
      Yes! We try to keep our sessions as modular as possible. If you need help
      with anything we've covered in a previous session, we'd be glad to bring you
      up to speed. We strive to be a friendly and welcoming group at all times.
